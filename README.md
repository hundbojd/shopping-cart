# Write a program to count the number of units of each type of product purchased by each customer of the online store.

# 
# The input to the program is the number n — the number of rows in the online store's sales database. This is followed by n lines with entries of the type buyer product quantity, where buyer is the name of the buyer (line without spaces), product is the name of the product (line without spaces), quantity is the number of purchased units of goods (natural number).
# 
# The program should display a list of all buyers in lexicographic order, after the name of each buyer — a colon, then a list of names of all goods purchased by him in lexicographic order, after the name of each product — the number of units of the product. Information about each product is displayed on a separate line.
# 
# Note. If the items of the goods are repeated, then the total number of goods for this item is included in the final list.
